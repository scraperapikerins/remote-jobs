# ScraperAPI

## Company blurb

Scraper API is an API that helps developers easily build scalable web scrapers. Unlike proxy providers that just give you a list of IP addresses, Scraper API handles IP rotation, headless browsers, and CAPTCHAs so developers can get the HTML of any web page with a simple API call. The developer experience is our key differentiator over our competitors. All you need to do is give us the URL and weâ€™ll return the HTML of the page.

Dan Ni, the founder of Scraper API
He created this tool because he often had web scraping jobs where I would go through the same boiler plate tasks (setting up proxy servers, handling IP rotation, running headless browsers, etc.)

We serve around 2 billion requests/month.
